Related scientific fact: ocean circulation does indeed impact climate variability on various time scales. It is fair to say that. The answer is yes.
The fact that so many studies on climate change don't bother to endorse the consensus position is significant because scientists have largely moved from what's causing global warming onto discussing details of the problem (eg - how fast, how soon, impacts, etc).
Ans returned is:  The claim suggests that the lack of endorsement of the consensus position in climate change studies is significant because scientists are focusing on discussing details of the problem. Related scientific fact: While there may be ongoing discussions about the details of climate change, the consensus among scientists is still strong regarding the main causes and impacts of global warming. It is fair to say that the focus has shifted to discussing details, but it is important to note that the consensus on the main causes of global warming remains. The answer is partially fair.

Water vapor helps trap heat, and is a far the strongest of the major greenhouse gases, contributing 36–72 percent of the greenhouse effect.
Ans returned is:  The claim states that water vapor is the strongest greenhouse gas contributing to the greenhouse effect. Related scientific fact: water vapor is indeed the most abundant greenhouse gas and contributes significantly to the greenhouse effect. It is fair to say that. The answer is yes.
Thus rather than a "doomsday" cycle of runaway warming, Mother Earth appears surprisingly tolerant of carbon, decreasing atmospheric levels of water vapor -- a more effective greenhouse gas -- to compensate.
Ans returned is:  The claim suggests that Mother Earth is tolerant of carbon and decreases atmospheric levels of water vapor to compensate for greenhouse gas effects. Related scientific fact: while water vapor is a potent greenhouse gas, its levels are largely influenced by temperature changes, not as a direct compensation for carbon dioxide. It is unfair to say that. The answer is no.

Ans returned is:  The claim states that the increase in CO2 is solely human-caused. Related scientific fact: the majority of the increase in CO2 levels in the atmosphere is indeed due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels. It is fair to say that. The answer is yes.
that atmospheric CO2 increase that we observe is a product of temperature  increase, and not the other way around, meaning it is a product of  natural variation...
Ans returned is:  The claim that atmospheric CO2 increase is a product of temperature increase and not the other way around is not fair to say. Scientifically, it is well-established that the increase in atmospheric CO2 is primarily due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, rather than being solely a product of natural temperature variations.
