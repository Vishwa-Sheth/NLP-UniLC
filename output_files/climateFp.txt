The contribution of waste heat to the global climate is 0.028 W/m2.
Ans returned is:  The statement that the contribution of waste heat to the global climate is 0.028 W/m2 is not accurate. The impact of waste heat on the global climate is a complex issue and cannot be simplified to a single numerical value. Waste heat generated by human activities, such as industrial processes and urbanization, can have significant localized effects on temperature and ecosystems, but its global impact is not easily quantifiable in a single number. It is important to consider a wide range of factors and variables when assessing the impact of waste heat on the climate.

However, more direct comparisons between solar activity and global temperature finds that  as the sun grew hotter or cooler, Earth's climate followed it with a 10 year lag - presumably due to the dampening effect of the ocean.
Ans returned is:  The claim suggests that Earth's climate follows changes in solar activity with a 10-year lag. Related scientific fact: While solar activity can influence Earth's climate, the relationship is complex and not solely determined by a simple 10-year lag.
Ans returned is:  No.
Also found was that the correlation between solar activity and global temperatures ended around 1975, hence recent warming must have some other cause than solar variations.
Ans returned is:  The claim that recent warming must have some other cause than solar variations because the correlation between solar activity and global temperatures ended around 1975 is not entirely accurate. While it is true that the correlation between solar activity and global temperatures weakened after 1975, it does not mean that solar variations have no impact on recent warming. Scientific studies have shown that while solar activity is a factor in influencing Earth's climate, the recent rapid increase in global temperatures is primarily attributed to human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, which release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Therefore, it is not fair to completely dismiss the role of solar variations
Ans returned is:  No.
